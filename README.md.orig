cleverbot
=========

An extensible IRC bot implemented using C++11 and Boost.Asio.

Working features
=========

By now the bot can connect to a IRC network, join channels, send private

messages, change nick, respond to ping command and quit. Here is a list of commands:

messages, change nick, op someone and quit. Here is a list of commands:
>>>>>>> unstable

* /m subject message - send a message to the subject (#channel, nick, etc.)
* /n newnick         - changes the bot's nickname
* /j #channel        - tries to join the channel #channel
* /op nick #channel  - Op nick in #channel
* /q message         - quits leaving a message

In the code side, it is possible to add read handlers, for example:

```
bot.add_read_handler([&bot](const std::string& m) {
	std::istringstream iss(m);
	std::string from, type, to, msg;
	
	iss >> from >> type >> to >> msg;
	
	if (msg == ":!time") {
		std::time_t now = std::chrono::system_clock::to_time_t(
			std::chrono::system_clock::now());
			
		bot.message(to, std::ctime(&now));
	}
});
```

This method call adds a read handler (a lamda function which takes an 
`const std::string` as argument) to the bot which prints the current time 
whenever some user sends a !time message on a channel in which the bot is in.

Building (g++ 4.7 and after):
=========

Cleverbot requires some new features of 
[C++11](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B11) and some libraries from 
[Boost](http://www.boost.org/) such as Boost.Asio and Boost.System.
